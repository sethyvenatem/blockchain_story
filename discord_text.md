This server is dedicated to collaboratively writing stories into blockchains!

The stories are written one chapter at a time. The participants can take two roles: writer and miner. The writers each write their version of the next chapter of the story and share it with the community. Then the miners pick one of the chapters and try to validate it. I.e. append it to the blockchain. This represents a large amount of computer work. If the chapter is popular, then many miners will try to add it. It will have a high chance of being quickly validated. This is important because the first contribution to be validated is (modulo some technicalities) accepted as the true official chapter. In this sense, the mining process is like a race. The fastest miner gets to fix the new chapter for everyone. Once a chapter is validated, then the authors can start writing the next chapter to submit to the miners for validation. This goes on forever or until the story ends.

On this server we share the files necessary to write such stories. The writers upload their chapter submissions to [#author-submissions](https://discord.com/channels/1133756102253740193/1133791244858966096). The miners download them, validate them and upload the updated story to [#validated-story](https://discord.com/channels/1133756102253740193/1133791437637558332). Writing a story in this way has original and interesting features:
- The story is cryptographically immutable. It's only possible to change the story by writing the next chapters and taking it somewhere interesting. The past cannot be changed.
- Anyone can pick up the story and add to it. The only requirement is to be able (through good writing) to convince the miners to validate your chapter.
- There can be no discussion about what version of the story is canon or who is an acceptable author. All this is cryptographically fixed by a precise set of rules.
- It teaches us about blockchains.
- It's fun and interesting to mix and match unrelated ideas.

#splitImplementation#split

I wrote a full implementation of the blockchain. The necessary scripts together with a detailed (and technical) description is available in the github repository: https://github.com/sethyvenatem/blockchain_story. This implementation is composed of three different python scripts that construct and assemble the different elements of the blockchain.

The authors are expected to run the first script, [**chapter_signature.py**](https://github.com/sethyvenatem/blockchain_story/blob/main/python_implementation/chapter_signature.py) on their own computer and manually upload the generated \*.json file to the [#author-submissions](https://discord.com/channels/1133756102253740193/1133791244858966096) channel of this server. This script takes the chapter written by an author and adds a digital signature on top of it. This ensures that the miners can't modify the author's work before validating it. This script runs without argument. The author is prompted for the chapter meta-data (story title, author name, chapter number and chapter title) as well as the name of a \*.txt file with the chapter text. This text file must be placed in the same directory as the **chapter_signature.py** script. The script creates a \*.json file that must be uploaded to [#author-submissions](https://discord.com/channels/1133756102253740193/1133791244858966096) where the miners can get it. This script also creates a \*.txt file where the chapter content is displayed in an easily readable form. Instead of running this script, the authors can also ask another member of the community to run the script for them, but then they cannot be sure their text will not be altered.

The miners run the second script, [**mining.py**](https://github.com/sethyvenatem/blockchain_story/blob/main/python_implementation/mining.py) with the chosen validated chapter as input. The script will run until the chapter is validated. This can take a looong time. The miners are expected to notify the community immediately (by uploading the newly validated story as a \*.json file) if the script terminates. That way, the other miners can stop mining and avoid waisting energy. This script performs the work to add a chapter to the blockchain. It must be called with the file names of the up-until-now validated story and the digitally signed chapter data as well as the name of the miner. The two files must be placed in the same directory as **mining.py**. Upon completion of the validation process, the miner is offered the possibility to send the newly validated story (placed in a \*.json file) directly to the [#validated-story](https://discord.com/channels/1133756102253740193/1133791437637558332) channel of this server. They can also upload the file manually.

The third script, [**checks.py**](https://github.com/sethyvenatem/blockchain_story/blob/main/python_implementation/checks.py) verifies that a given story file is correctly validated and follows the rules of the story. It must be run with the name of the file to check as argument. The selected file must be placed in the same directory as **checks.py**. This script can check chapter data, digitally signed chapter data, individual blocks and full (although possibly unfinished) stories. If all the checks are passed, then the scripts creates a \*.txt file with the content of the story in an easily readable form.

The detailed rules of each individual story are set in the genesis block (chapter 0). The different field names make these rules quite self-explanatory. Everybody is invited to take a look at the first block of any story they want to contribute to. See [genesis_block.json](https://github.com/sethyvenatem/blockchain_story/blob/main/python_implementation/genesis_block.json) in the github repository for the details.


#splitRecommandations#split

For the story writing to go on smoothly it is recommended that the miners only attempt to add a chapter to the earliest version of the longest validated story. If there are multiple versions of the validated story that all have the same number of chapters, then pick the oldest one! Each block has a mining_date field that can be checked to be sure. The mining date of the last block is also included at the end of the file name. If a miner use another version, then it is highly probable that another miner will validate their block first. Moreover, when there are multiple validated stories, then the validation date is used to decide which story is official. Attempting to append a block to an unofficial story will most likely lead to pointless work for the miner's computer and waisted energy.

Authors should proofread their submissions and run them through a spell-checker. Indeed, once a block is validated, it becomes impossible to change. Typos will be there forever!

The mining procedure is like repeatedly throwing many dices until all-sixes come out. There is no memory of what was tried and no progress. It's all about trying long enough until the right combination comes out. It is therefore completely ok to interrupt a computer engaged in mining and start again later. No progress will be lost and the chances of validating a block will not be reduced. The only thing that matters is the total amount of time that the computer is working.
