\f0\fs24 \cf0 to_do:\
- write up rules\
- test and learn about chat thing\
\'97 discord, messages stay forever, file size limit 8MB\
- Is it ok to use file names to load chapters? Maybe better hash values?\
- What if there are multiple stories or multiple branches in the same folder?\
- Make things easier:\
\'97 Change the chapter_security\
\'97- Make it work with copy-pasting, what happens to line returns? Make sure that they are preserved.\
\'97- Have it generated the secure_chapter_data together with something readable (pdf).\
\'97- change the file names so that users can have different proposals in the same folder\
\'97- include chapter number in file name to make it straightforward\
\'97 include largest chapter number in file name of validated story\
- use the validated genesis block whenever possible.\
- include the story title in the chapter data\
- set up requirements file and learn how to use it\
- structure the json files so that hashes are evaluated from sub-blocks instead of block with hash removed.\
